This is a cut-down version of the Solr 3.1 distro for getting started with Solr and the fulltextsearch module.

For the full version, and more information about Solr, visit http://lucene.apache.org/solr/

If using the full version, make sure the Solr home directory is a copy of server/solr - it contains configuration (multi-core enabled, etc) that
the fulltextsearch module expects
